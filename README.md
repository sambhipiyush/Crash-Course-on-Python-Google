## About this Course

This course is designed to teach you the foundations in order to write simple programs in Python using the most common structures. No previous exposure to programming is needed. By the end of this course, you'll understand the benefits of programming in IT roles; be able to write simple programs using Python; figure out how the building blocks of programming fit together; and combine all of this knowledge to solve a complex programming problem. 

We'll start off by diving into the basics of writing a computer program. Along the way, you’ll get hands-on experience with programming concepts through interactive exercises and real-world examples. You’ll quickly start to see how computers can perform a multitude of tasks — you just have to write code that tells them what to do.

## Syllabus

### WEEK 1

* **Key Concepts**
	* Navigate the Coursera platform and find resources for help
	* Define what a programming language is and what syntax means
	* Define what a script is and how it applies to automation
	* List some of the benefits of the Python programming language
	* Utilize basic functions and keywords to display data and perform arithmetic operations

#### Module 1: Hello Python!

In this module we’ll introduce you to the Coursera platform and the course format. Then, we’ll dive into the basics of programming languages and syntax, as well as automation using scripting. We’ll also introduce you to the Python programming language and some of the benefits it offers. Last up, we’ll cover some basic functions and keywords of the language, along with some arithmetic operations.

### WEEK 2

* **Key Concepts**
	* Differentiate and convert between different data types utilizing variables
	* Define and call functions utilizing parameters and return data
	* Refactor code and write comments to reduce complexity and enhance code readability and code reuse
	* Compare values using equality operators and logical operators
	* Build complex branching scripts utilizing if, else and elif statements

#### Module 2: Basic Python Syntax

In this module you’ll learn about different data types in Python, how to identify them, and how to convert between them. You’ll also learn how to use variables to assign data and to reference variables. You’ll deep dive into functions: how to define them, pass them parameters, and have them return information. You’ll explore the concepts of code reuse, code style, and refactoring complex code, along with effectively using code comments. Finally, you’ll learn about comparing data using equality and logical operators, and leveraging these to build complex branching scripts using if statements.

### WEEK 3

* **Key Concepts**
	* Implement while loops to continuously execute code
	* Identify and fix infinite loops when using while loops
	* Utilize for loops to iterate over sets of data
	* Use the range() function to control for loops
	* Identify and correct common errors when using loops


#### Module 3: Loops

In this module you'll explore the intricacies of loops in Python! You'll learn how to use while loops to continuously execute code, as well as how to identify infinite loop errors and how to fix them. You'll also learn to use for loops to iterate over data, and how to use the range() function with for loops. You'll also explore common errors when using for loops and how to fix them.

### WEEK 4

* **Key Concepts**
	* Manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and formatting
	* Use lists and tuples to store, reference, and manipulate data
	* Leverage dictionaries to store more complex data, reference data by keys, and manipulate data stored
	* Combine these data types to construct complex data structures


#### Module 4: Strings, Lists and Dictionaries

In this module you'll dive into more advanced ways to manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and advanced formatting. You'll also explore the more advanced data types: lists, tuples, and dictionaries. You'll learn to store, reference, and manipulate data in these structures, as well as combine them to store complex data structures.

### WEEK 5

* **Key Concepts**
	* Demonstrate object-oriented programming using classes and objects
	* Implement classes with custom attributes and methods
	* Write docstrings to document classes and methods
	* Leverage inheritance to reduce code duplication
	* Import and use Python modules to access powerful classes and methods


#### Module 5: Object Oriented Programming (Optional)

In this module you'll dive into more advanced ways to manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and advanced formatting. You'll also explore the more advanced data types: lists, tuples, and dictionaries. You'll learn to store, reference, and manipulate data in these structures, as well as combine them to store complex data structures.

**Graded:** No Graded Assignment

### WEEK 6

* **Key Concepts**
	* Tackle more complex problems from the ground up using a framework
	* Formulate a problem statement to understand the inputs and outputs of a script
	* Conduct research into options for tackling the problem
	* Plan an approach to solving the problem
	* Write a complex script in order to implement a solution


#### Module 6: Strings, Lists and Dictionaries

In this module, you'll put everything you've learned so far into action! You'll apply a problem-solving framework to tackle a challenging final project: implementing a script that generates a "word cloud" from some text.

You'll formulate a problem statement to understand the challenge, conduct some research to see what options are available, then begin planning how you intend to solve the problem. Lastly, you'll write the code to implement your solution!
