# Code Reuse

Let’s put what we learned about code reuse all together. 
<br><br>
First, let’s look back at **inheritance**. Run the following cell that defines a generic `Animal` class. 


```python
class Animal:
    name = ""
    category = ""
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def set_category(self, category):
        self.category = category
```

What we have is not enough to do much -- yet. That’s where you come in. 
<br><br>
In the next cell, define a `Turtle` class that inherits from the `Animal` class. Then go ahead and set its category. For instance, a turtle is generally considered a reptile. Although modern cladistics call this categorization into question, for purposes of this exercise we will say turtles are reptiles! 


```python
class Turtle(Animal):
    category = 'reptile'
```

Run the following cell to check whether you correctly defined your `Turtle` class and set its category to reptile.


```python
print(Turtle.category)
```

    reptile


Was the output of the above cell reptile? If not, go back and edit your `Turtle` class making sure that it inherits from the `Animal` class and its category is properly set to reptile. Be sure to re-run that cell once you've finished your edits. Did you get it? If so, great!

Next, let’s practice **composition** a little bit. This one will require a second type of `Animal` that is in the same category as the first. For example, since you already created a `Turtle` class, go ahead and create a `Snake` class. Don’t forget that it also inherits from the `Animal` class and that its category should be set to reptile.


```python
class Snake(Animal):
    category = 'reptile'
```

Now, let’s say we have a large variety of `Animal`s (such as turtles and snakes) in a Zoo. Below we have the `Zoo` class. We’re going to use it to organize our various `Animal`s. Remember, inheritance says a Turtle is an `Animal`, but a `Zoo` is not an `Animal` and an `Animal` is not a `Zoo` -- though they are related to one another. 

Fill in the blanks of the `Zoo` class below so that you can use **zoo.add_animal( )** to add instances of the `Animal` subclasses you created above. Once you’ve added them all, you should be able to use **zoo.total_of_category( )** to tell you exactly how many individual `Animal` types the `Zoo` has for each category! Be sure to run the cell once you've finished your edits.


```python
class Zoo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_animals = {}
    
    def add_animal(self, animal):
        self.current_animals[animal.name] = animal.category
    
    def total_of_category(self, category):
        result = 0
        for animal in self.current_animals.values():
            if animal == category:
                result += 1
        return result

zoo = Zoo()
```

Run the following cell to check whether you properly filled in the blanks of your `Zoo` class.


```python
turtle = Turtle("Turtle") #create an instance of the Turtle class
snake = Snake("Snake") #create an instance of the Snake class

zoo.add_animal(turtle)
zoo.add_animal(snake)

print(zoo.total_of_category("reptile")) #how many zoo animal types in the reptile category
```

    2


Was the output of the above cell 2? If not, go back and edit the `Zoo` class making sure to fill in the blanks with the appropriate attributes. Be sure to re-run that cell once you've finished your edits.  
<br>
Did you get it? If so, perfect! You have successfully defined your `Turtle` and `Snake` subclasses as well as your `Zoo` class.  You are all done with this notebook. Great work!
