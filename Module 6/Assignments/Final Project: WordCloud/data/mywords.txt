JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages.
It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.
It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted
by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the 
page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.
